CHECKING THE PLANETS

Imagine you are a space explorer with a list of the planets in the solar system that looks like this: 
Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. 
The program should display a list of planets and ask if it is necessary to check that each planet is in its correct place. 
If you type Y, the program will ask for the planet’s name, 
display its location in the solar system, and ask you to confirm that the planet’s location is correct. 
If you enter N, indicating the planet is not in its place, the program will ask for the number of another planet with which they must be swapped. 
After that, or if you type Y, the program should ask again if there is another planet to check.
If you type N, the program will exit. Y answer equates to yes, and N answer or any others equate to no. 
Before searching for the position of the entered planet by name, 
the program must check whether such a planet is even in the list and output an error if it is not,
returning to the question about checking the planet. 
Planet numbers, as well as list indices, must start with 0.
When entering Y or N, the case must not be taken into account.
